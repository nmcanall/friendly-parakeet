# Password Generator
This application built the JavaScript code from a pre-existing user interface.  It prompts
the user for a password length and asks to choose between lowercase, uppercase, arabic 
numerals, and special characters.  Once the user makes appropriate inputs, the system will
generate a random password based on the specifications.  It will then print the password
to the user interface.
